First TOP project

I need to make a recipe web page that links to recipes online. This will 
demonstrate that I have learned how to use boilerplate html, embed links in 
text, commit work to github, format text with html tags, link to other pages 
using a relative path,organise web page files in the right directory and write
useful and succinct commit messages.
